HueMove
=======

HueMove is a simple Windows application for [Philips' hue lights](https://www.meethue.com) designed to help
you get up and move around periodically. Every hour it will set all the lights you have on to red and keep them
that way until you should sit back down.

## Features
 - Snooze allows you to put off getting up during critical times.
 - The amount of time you should stay up adapts to how long since you last got up.
 - MIT Licensed.
